## Details

This is a sample project I developed to explore Wix Headless CMS and experiment with Zustand State management. It uses Next server actions, Context, Hooks and middleware.
It features user account creation, the ability to add items to a cart, and inventory management through Wix Headless, which is displayed on the site. Additionally, the site is fully responsive.
